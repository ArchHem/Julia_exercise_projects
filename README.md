##Machine learning - analyzing the MNIST dataset using home-built `neural_network struct`.

-Home-built, medium-performance feed-forward neural network implementation using base Julia library

-3 layer network capable of 96% accuracy on the test-split of the MNIST dataset. 

-main `struct` capable of constructing any feed-forward network architecture

-Potential future improvements include implementing other gradient-descent methods such as ADAM, and type declaration in main `struct`, or symbolic differention using `Symbolics.jl`, to achieve high performance
